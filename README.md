# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

# Overview

This analysis was done in an effort to analyze reviews on Amazon by paid members of the Amazon Vine program which allows manufacturers to receive reviews for their products by providing products to members of the program who are then required to review it. The company which sponsored this analysis, SellBy, is interested in seeing how membership in the Vine program might affect the likelihood of someone providing a five star review for the product they received.
